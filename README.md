## Objective
 dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. Your tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your findings graphically. Here's a breakdown of what I have done.
* Step1: Import relevant modules 
* step2: Data load as csv file
* step3: Data Cleaning and preprocess
 Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180.
 Replace the NaN with Uknown in Column College
#### 1. Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
insight: By plotting Bar chart
* The New Orleans Pelicans lead with the highest percentage of employees, suggesting a larger team size relative to others.
* The Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic are at the lower end with the smallest percentage of employees.
* Teams with a higher percentage of employees might require more management resources or could indicate a focus area. On the other hand, teams with fewer employees might face challenges in workload distribution or could be candidates for expansion.
Overall, while there are some slight variations, the relatively uniform distribution suggests well-managed staffing across different teams.

#### 2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
Insight:
The chart specifically highlights that the SG (Shooting Guard) position has exactly 100 employees, meeting the specified range. This indicates a significant presence of shooting guards in the organization.
#### 3. Identify the predominant age group among employees.

4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.
